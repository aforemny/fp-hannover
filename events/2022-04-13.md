*Slot 1: Project Fluent (@Fabian)*

We will take a look at [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/), a solution for offering websites in different languages and localizing things like numbers, dates, etc..  In particular we will try to find out which use cases can be easily done with it and which not, and we will see how one can integrate fluent in an Elm application using https://github.com/wolfadex/fluent-web/.

*Slot 2: Sneak.Page (@Marvin)*

We will continue with our real-live Elm web app [sneak.page](https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/sneak.page) which shows info about past and upcoming sneak previews.
Feel welcome to have a look at the [source](https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/sneak.page) and [mockup](https://www.figma.com/proto/xa7WL6OE4tMpX2WScvv3zr/Sneak.Page?node-id=19%3A23979&viewport=-699%2C385%2C0.4106914699077606&scaling=min-zoom). Integrating [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) and [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) directly into [sneak.page](https://sneak.page/) after Fabian's talk is planned and maybe even more. I will prepare my IDE and you can tell me what to do. ðŸ‘Œ
