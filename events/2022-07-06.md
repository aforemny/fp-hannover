*Slot 1: atools (@Alexander)*

I am working on a small set of personal, plain-text based and CLI productivity
tools and want to share my latest updates.

*Slot 2: Elm editor (@Michael)*

[Elm Editor](https://github.com/elm-fullstack/elm-fullstack/tree/main/implement/example-apps/elm-editor) is a web-based editor for Elm programs. It helps novice programmers by automating the setup and configuration of the various tools that make up a complete development environment.
We will take a look under the hood and learn how Elm Editor integrates development tools and implements the functionality enhancing our productivity and helping us navigate our projects.
If you want to test-drive Elm Editor in advance, check out the demo at https://elm-editor.com


*Optional Book club: [DATA AND REALITY (W. Kent)](https://www.google.com/search?q=data+and+reality)*
For anyone interested, we are going to discuss the first chapter *2 THE NATURE
OF AN INFORMATION SYSTEM*.
