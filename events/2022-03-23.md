*Slot 1: composable-forms (@Alexander)*

We are going to take a look at the Elm package [hecrj/composable-form](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/hecrj/composable-form/latest/) which allows us to define type-safe, composable forms in Elm with ease.

*Slot 2: composable-forms (@Alexander)*

In the second session, we are going to take a look at the limitations of composable forms, and how we can overcome them by forking the excellent underlying API.
