*Slot 1: Design Patterns (@Peter)*

*Slot 2: PostgREST (@Alexander)*
We are going to take a look at [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org), a web server
application that turns your [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database
into a [RESTful
API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
