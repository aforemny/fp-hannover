*Slot 1: NEAT (@Alexander)*
[NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) is a generic algorithm for the evolution of artificial neural networks featuring topological crossover, innovation preservation and incremental topology development. We are going to take a cursory look at the key concepts of the algorithm described in the [2002 paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?stanley:ec02).

*Slot 2: Elm compiler (@Fabian)*
We will have a look at the source code of the [elm compiler](https://github.com/elm/compiler).  The goal is to get an idea of its structure and see if we can do little adjustments to change part of Elm's Kernel code.  In particular we will try to give `Cmd`s a `Task`-like API.

*Optional Book club: [DATA AND REALITY (W. Kent)](https://www.google.com/search?q=data+and+reality)*
For anyone interested, we are going to discuss the first chapter *1 ENTITIES*.
