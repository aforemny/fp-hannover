*Slot 1: Elm Silent Teacher (@Michael)*

In this session, we are going to have a look at [Silent Teacher](https://silentteacher.toxicode.fr/), a minimalist game that aims to teach the core concepts of coding, with not a single explaination given.

*Slot 2: Meetup Integration (@Alexander)*

A new year, a new meetup.. a new website! We're going to take a look at the infrastructure that we can write this year. Hopefully, we can pick up a few new tools on our way!
