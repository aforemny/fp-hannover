# Hannover Functional Programming Meetup

This is a group for anyone interested in functional programming and related technology.

We are organizing a monthly meetup to share our current projects and interests, to discuss functional programming in general, and to provide guidance on learning.

We are currently invested in the following technology, but what we offer changes with who is attending:

- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Nix/ NixOS](https://nixos.org/)

Our events will usually be held in German, but we are happy to switch to English!
